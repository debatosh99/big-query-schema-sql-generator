You should implement exponential backoff for API calls when you receive HTTP response codes that indicate transient errors or rate limiting, where a retry might succeed after a short delay. The most common and recommended status codes for exponential backoff are:

HTTP 5xx (500–599): Server errors, which are usually temporary (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error, 502 Bad Gateway, 503 Service Unavailable, and 504 Gateway Timeout).

HTTP 429: Too Many Requests (rate limiting), indicating the server is overloaded or you are exceeding a usage quota.

These codes are good candidates for retrying with exponential backoff because the error is usually not permanent, and aggressive immediate retries could further worsen the situation.

Summary Table:

Status Code Range	Description	   Should Retry With Backoff?
500–599	           Server errors	    Yes
429	               Too Many Requests	Yes
400–499(except 429)	Client errors	    No (usually not recoverable)
For other 4xx errors (except 429), such as 400 (Bad Request) or 401 (Unauthorized), exponential backoff is not recommended because these typically indicate a permanent issue with the request, not a transient problem.

So, to summarize:

Retry with exponential backoff on HTTP 5xx and 429.

Do NOT apply backoff to most other 4xx or 2xx codes.

How it works:
Exponential Delay:
wait_time = backoff_factor * (2 ** attempt) gives delays like:
1s → 2s → 4s → 8s...

Retry Conditions:

Will retry if status code is 429 (rate limiting)

Will retry if status code is in 500–599 range

Will retry if network/connection errors occur

Will stop immediately on status 200

Immediate Success Exit:
As soon as a successful 200 OK arrives, no further retries are attempted — it prints the JSON and returns.

Test Endpoint:
Using jsonplaceholder.typicode.com as a mock API, but replace with your own endpoint.

If you want, I can extend this example to also respect Retry-After headers for APIs like Atlassian or OpenAI — that would make it a production-grade backoff strategy.

Do you want me to add that? That’s common for smart backoff handling.
