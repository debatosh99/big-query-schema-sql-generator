let's enhance the Python exponential backoff example so that it will also respect an API’s Retry-After header when present (common for rate-limited APIs like Atlassian, OpenAI, GitHub, etc.).

This makes the retry smarter — instead of always doubling the wait time, if the server tells us exactly how many seconds to wait, we follow that

Changes from the previous version
Looks for the Retry-After header:

If found, uses that exact server-specified wait time.

If it’s invalid or missing, falls back to exponential wait time.

Still supports transient network errors with backoff.

Immediate exit on success so you don’t waste retries.

Works with APIs like Atlassian & OpenAI that send Retry-After in seconds.

Example Scenario:
API returns 429 Too Many Requests and header: Retry-After: 10 → waits exactly 10 seconds, then retries.

API returns 503 Service Unavailable without header → waits exponential time (1s → 2s → 4s...).

API returns 400 → stops immediately (non-retryable).

If you want, I can also make a FastAPI middleware version of this, so all API calls from your AI agent follow this retry+backoff+Retry-After logic automatically.

Do you want me to prepare that next? That would integrate nicely with your React + FastAPI AI chat project.
